👋 Hey everyone! I'm excited to share a new repository I just published with two Python scripts for having text-based conversations with AI language models. 🤖🗣🗣️ With these scripts, you can chat with an AI model directly in the terminal or get two models to converse with each other and save their conversation (Weirdly fascinating...).



👩‍💻 I'm the author of these scripts (with some help from AI tools 😉), and I'm excited to be sharing them. They're easy to use and require only Python 3 and the llm package (and an OpenAI API key).



👉 Check out the repository and give the scripts a try - I can't wait to hear what you think! Screenshots are on the link below. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback. 🙌
