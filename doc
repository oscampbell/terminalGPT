# terminalGPT Documentation

## Introduction

terminalGPT is a Python program that provides a terminal interface for OpenAI's GPT-3 chat tool. It allows users to chat with the GPT-3 AI directly from the terminal.

The program stores each chat session in a separate file, and automatically generates a meaningful file name using the content of the chat session. This makes it easier to keep track of previous chat sessions and to find them later.

## Installation

**Note**: The program was only tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

### 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AbdullahM0hamed/terminalGPT.git
$ cd terminalGPT
```

### 2. Install dependencies

terminalGPT requires several dependencies that must be installed before running the program.

- Python 3
- Pip
- [LLM](https://github.com/simonw/llm.git) (a Python package used to interact with GPT-3)

You can check if you have Python 3 and Pip installed by running the following commands:

```bash
$ python3 --version
$ pip --help
```

If you do not have one or both of these programs installed, you will have to install them.

To install LLM, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install llm
```

### 3. Configure API key

Before running the program, you must obtain an API key for OpenAI's GPT-3 service. You can get a key by following the instructions on the [official OpenAI GPT-3 API page](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

Once you have the API key, paste it in the `llm.key` file that is located in the `terminalGPT` directory.

### 4. Run the program

Finally, to run the program, navigate to the `terminalGPT` directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ python3 terminalGPT.py
```

## Usage

### Starting a new chat

After running the program, you will see a menu that shows the list of previous chat sessions. If this is your first time running the program, you will see an empty list.

To start a new chat, type `0` and press Enter. This will start a new chat session and automatically generate a meaningful name for the chat session file. The chat sessions are saved in the `terminalGPT/chats` directory.

### Resuming a previous chat

If you want to resume a previous chat session, select the index number of the chat session and press Enter.

**Note**: You can only resume the chat session that was started in the current session of terminalGPT.

### Chatting with GPT-3

Once you have started or resumed the chat session, you can start chatting with GPT-3 AI. Type your question and press Enter. The program will then send the question to GPT-3 and display the AI's response.

At any time during the chat session, you can type `exit` and press Enter to end the chat session.

### Renaming the chat session file

After ending the chat session, the program will automatically generate a meaningful file name based on the content of the chat session. If you want to change the file name, you can do so manually by renaming the file in the `terminalGPT/chats` directory.
